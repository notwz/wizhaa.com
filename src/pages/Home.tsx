              Hi! I'm Will, a student at Cornell University double majoring in
              Computer Science and Economics. I am also pursuing a minor in
              Business and Data Science. I am constantly looking for ways to
              improve my skills, broaden my worldview, and leave an impact. I
              get excited about tackling unique and challenging problems,
              collaborating with other talented minds, and bringing solutions to
              life with technology. I have tons of experience in software
              development, product management, UI/UX design principles, and
              working within large organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time, I love to spend time with friends and family by
              cooking, reading, lifting heavy, and drinking tea!
            </p>
            <p>
              I would love to connect with new people - feel free to message me
              or email me at wz282@cornell.edu!
            </p>
