              Hi! I'm Will, a prospective Cornell University graduate with a
              Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and minors in Business,
              Economics, and Informational Sciences. Last summer, I have worked
              at Pupil on their user onboarding and matching functionality. On
              Campus, I work as a Technical Product Manager at Design & Tech
              Initiative and as the President of our Computer Science Club,
              where we build products for community impact and provide outreach
              for students!
            </p>
