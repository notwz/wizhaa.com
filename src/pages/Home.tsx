              I'm Will, a sophomore studying Computer Science and Business at
              Cornell University. Last summer, I have worked at Pupil on their
              user onboarding and matching functionality. On Campus, I work as a
              Technical Product Manager at Design & Tech Initiative, where we
              build products for community impact!
